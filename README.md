## FAQs

This fork is for my personal use and shared here for others to waste less time in getting the software up and running.
That being sad, I don't have the resources available for general user support. While I gladly accept PR's that solve
problems that I encounter personally or are reproduced trivially within the confines of my setup, I cannot do this
for anything else (upstream issues, for example).
